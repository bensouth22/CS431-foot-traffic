# CS431-foot-traffic

This repository contains the final code for a semester-long project in CS431 Advanced Computer Networks. The goal of this project was to develop an autonomous system that could detect and record activity in an enclosed space (i.e. _foot traffic_) remotely. Foot traffic was detected through the use of Arduinos equipped with IR motion sensors and sound sensors. Every data point was then automatically recorded into a Google Sheet through a Google script connected to Arduino's IoT Cloud.
